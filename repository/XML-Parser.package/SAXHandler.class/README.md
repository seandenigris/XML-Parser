This class is an XML parser that uses event handling. The acronym "SAX" refers to Java's "Simple API for XML," on which SAXHandler's API is based. To use this class, create a subclass and override handlers under the "content" and "lexical" categories as needed. To instantiate it, send #on: or any of the #parse- messages to the class. The #on: message creates a new parser on the given input string or stream and returns it; the instance can then be further configured and ultimately sent #parseDocument to parse the given input. The class-side #parse- messages take some input source and parse it immediately, returning the result of #parseDocument.

By default, namespace support is enabled.
