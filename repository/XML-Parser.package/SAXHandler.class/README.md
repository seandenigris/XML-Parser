A SAXHandler is an XML parser that uses event handling. The acronym "SAX" refers to Java's "Simple API for XML," on which SAXHandler's API is based. To use this class, create a subclass and override handlers in "content" and "lexical" as needed. To instantiate it you can send #on: or any of the #parse- messages. The former creates a new parser on the given input stream and returns it; the instance can then be sent #parseDocument to parse the input. The #parse- messages take some input source and parse it, returning the result of #parseDocument.

By default, namespace support is enabled.
