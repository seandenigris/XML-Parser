This class represents a preserved CDATA section from a parsed document. It behaves like its superclass, except that its printed form differs in that it contains a "<![CDATA[" prefix and a "]]>" suffix and its contents are NOT escaped. By default, CDATA sections are converted to regular string nodes during parsing.

To preserve them as CDATA nodes, use #preservesCDataNodes: with the DOM parser before parsing.
