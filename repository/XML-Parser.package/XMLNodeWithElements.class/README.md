This class represents a node with elements. You will likely use its API through XMLDocument or XMLElement objects.

To retrieve child elements by name, you can send any of the #element- messages under "accessing." The #firstTag- messages search the receiver and its descendants using depth-first traversal for specific elements, and the #tagsNamed- messages iterate over descendent elements also using depth-first traversal.
