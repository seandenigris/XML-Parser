This class represents a node with child nodes. You will likely use its API through either XMLDocument or XMLElement. To retrieve child elements by name, you can send any of the #element- messages in "accessing." The #firstTag- messages search the receiver and its descendants using depth-first traversal for specific elements, and the #tagsNamed- messages perform some sort of iteration over descendent elements also using depth-first traversal.
