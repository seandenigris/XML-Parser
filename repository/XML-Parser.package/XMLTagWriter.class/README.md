This class generates XML tags for elements. You can specifiy the attributes of the start tag using the #attribute* messages, and you can add xmlns: namespace declarations using the #xmlns* messages. If you do not send #content:, or if you do but the argument is nil or a block that generates no markup, then only a single, empty tag in the form of "<empty />" will be generated, unless the writer object that created the tag writer object is configured to generate canonical XML, in which case an empty start/end tag pair like "<empty></empty>" will be generated.

You can supply child markup content using #content: or the generic #with: message. Namespace declarations will be ignored if a parent element has equivalent declarations (and they were thus already generated).
