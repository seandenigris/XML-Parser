SAXParserDriver together with SAXHandler provides a SAX-like API for XML parsing. The driver processes XML tokens and signals SAX events to a SAXHandler. To use it, create a subclass of SAXHandler and override messages to handle SAX events of interest. See "instance creation" on the class-side of SAXHandler for ways to instantiate such a parser.
