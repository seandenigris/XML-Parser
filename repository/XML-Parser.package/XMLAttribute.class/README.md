The class represents an attribute node, to be stored in an XMLAttributeList. You generally won't need to interact with these objects directly; XMLElement's various #attribute- messages will normally suffice. The name of an XMLAttribute can be namespaced using prefixes; however, the prefix must be mapped to a namespace URI in the parent XMLElement. Unprefixed attributes have no namespace, not even the default one, per the XML namespaces standard.
