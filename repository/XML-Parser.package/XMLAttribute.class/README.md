The class represents an attribute node, to be stored in an attribute node list. You generally won't need to interact with these objects directly; the various #attribute- messages element nodes respond to will normally suffice. The name of an attribute node can be namespaced using prefixes; however, the prefix must be mapped to a namespace URI in the containing element node. Unprefixed attributes have no namespace, not even a default namespace URI if one is in scope, per the XML namespace standard.
