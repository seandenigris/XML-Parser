The class represents an attribute node, to be stored in an XMLAttributeList. You generally won't need to interact with these objects directly; XMLElement's various #attribute- messages will normally suffice. The name of an attribute node can be namespaced using prefixes; however, the prefix must be mapped to a namespace URI in the containing element node. Unprefixed attributes have no namespace, not even the default one, per the XML namespaces standard.

Note that attribute nodes are not children of the elements that contain them; rather, they are considered to be "part" of the element, and this relationship is modeled using a separate instance variable ("element") with different accessor messages.
